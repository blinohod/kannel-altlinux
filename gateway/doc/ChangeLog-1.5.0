    * configure[.in]: make sure we use the packaged install script rather
      then the system own install on Interix 3. The system own version has
      no option -d support.
    * gwlib/counter.c: Interix 3 has pthread spinlocks, but they seem to
      be experimental and block the system. We'll use mutex locks instead.
    * gwlib/gwlib.h: Interix 3 has no strtoll(), but strtoq() provides the
      equivalent functionality.
    * gwlib/gwthread.h: Interix 3 has no sys/poll.h, so ignore the inclusion
      for this platform.
    * gwlib/socket.c: use gw_netaddr_to_octstr() instead of inet_ntop(), due
      to the fact that the later is not provided in Interix 3.
    * gwlib/utils.c: there is no initgroups() in Interix 3, so avoid the call
      for this specific platform.

      DLR SMSC SUCCESS|FAIL events, due that we handle the last chunk here, we
      didn't get hold of the FID. We need to duplicate it to the split list 
      original too, in order to have it available later, when the last chunk 
      us handled for the DLR events.
      Thanks to Gianluca Moretti <gianluca.moretti at hotmail dot it> for report.

     index in the sim. For some modems such as the UMG181 this needs to be set to
     0. Defaults to 1, and doesn't need changing for most others.
     Thanks to to Nikos Balkanas <nbal at amdtelecom.net> for this patch.

      fixed default settings for Siemens TC35
      this should make hanging TC35's a thing of the past

2010-03-09  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: we use UTF-8 as default encoding for the
      payload and not WINDOWS-1252. This caused a lot of mis-understanding.
    * gw/smsbox.c: fix also the comment. NLC.

2010-02-28 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/bearerbox.c: don't ignore errors on startup. This fixes #536.

2010-01-21  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_boxc.c: fix a duplicate store_save_ack() call in case we get
      SMSCCONN_FAILED_DISCARDED as result of our smsc routing call. In this
      case we HAVE already called the store_save_ack(), and hence yield an
      ERROR line that we're unable to unlink the file from a spool directory.

2010-01-20  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * utils/start-stop-daemon.c: fix FreeBSD build, removed the redundant
      command here that breaks the build. NLC.

2010-01-19 Andreas Fink <andreas at fink.org>
    * gwlib/charset.c partially revert last change.
      GSM charset character 09 is encoded differently by various vendors.
      Nokia and Apple show a small c cedille.
      Ericcson and Android show a capital C cedile
      The standard GSM ETSI TS 123 038 V8.2.0 (2008-10) shows a 
      capital, even though french speakers who have invented GSM
      will agree that it most likely was meant as small (in french you dont
      write capital C cedille but you use small c cedille often).
      Capital and small c cedile get encoded into 09.
      09 gets decoded to capital c cedille as it is in the standard.

2010-01-19 Andreas Fink <andreas at fink.org>
    * gwlib/charset.c Fixed french character c cedille. In GSM 23.38-700 it 
      looks like a capital C cedille for code point 0x09. Real life phones
      however display a small c cedille for code 0x09. The change does
      encode capital and small C cedille into 0x09 and decodes to small C
      on incoming. Before a small c cedille resulted in a questionmark.

2010-01-11 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>

    * gw/smsc/smsc_loopback.c: make sure we create an new UUID for the MO we
      are about to loopback via this smsc. This is more realistic by means that
      other smsc modules also create an own UUID for a logical MO.

    * aclocal.m4, configure, configure.in, gw/dlr_mysql.c, gwlib/dbpool_mysql.c,
      test/test_dbpool.c: implemented select/update function calls for dbpool_mysql. This
      require mysql prepared statement support and therefore mysql version >= 4.1.
